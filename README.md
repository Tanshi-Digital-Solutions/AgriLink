## Project Overview

Agriculture is a cornerstone of many African economies, yet farmers often face challenges such as limited access to capital, fragmented land ownership, and a lack of investment opportunities. AgriLink addresses these issues by providing a decentralized platform where:

- **Farmers** can raise funds and access pooled land resources.
- **Landowners** can contribute land for larger-scale farming projects.
- **Investors** can discover and fund agricultural projects, with all transactions managed securely through smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **Crowdfunding**: Farmers can raise capital for their projects by appealing to a global network of investors.
- **Land Pooling**: Facilitates the collaboration of landowners to create larger, more efficient farming operations.
- **Investment Opportunities**: Investors can diversify their portfolios by investing in a range of agricultural projects, with transparent ROI tracking.
- **Blockchain Security**: All transactions and agreements are secured and executed on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust.
- **Sustainable Practices**: Promotes eco-friendly and sustainable farming methods to ensure long-term viability and environmental protection.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - Kotlin (for mobile app)
- **Backend**:
